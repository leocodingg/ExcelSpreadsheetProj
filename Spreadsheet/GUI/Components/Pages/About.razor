<h1>About</h1>

Welcome to my spreadsheet project! This project implements a web-based spreadsheet using 
C# and Blazor. It integrates with a custom Spreadsheet class (from CS3500.Spreadsheet) 
and a Formula class (from CS3500.Formula) to handle spreadsheet logic. Users can edit 
cell contents, enter formulas, view evaluated values, undo changes, and load/save 
spreadsheet data in JSON format.

<h3>General Information</h3>

<h6>Rows and Columns</h6>
<p>The spreadsheet supports 50 rows and 26 columns (labeled A–Z).
    Each cell is identified by a column letter followed by a row number (e.g., A1, B10, etc.).</p>

<h6>Cell Editing</h6>
<p>Clicking a cell selects it and displays its contents in an editable text box (e.g., =A1+10).
    The evaluated value of the cell (e.g., 20) is shown in a read-only field.</p>

<h6>Formulas</h6>
<p>Formulas start with = (e.g., =A2 + B3 * 2).
    The system uses FormulaFormatException to handle syntax errors and FormulaError objects 
    to handle runtime errors (like division by zero).</p>

<h6>Error Handling</h6>
<p>If a cell’s formula leads to an error, the cell shows “Error”.
    A modal window displays details of the error (e.g., circular references, invalid syntax, etc.).</p>

<h6>Saving and Loading</h6>
<p>Save: Serializes the entire spreadsheet to JSON and prompts a file download (default name: Spreadsheet.sprd).
    Load: Users select a JSON file, and the code parses it to restore all cell contents and values.</p>

<h3>Special Features</h3>

<h6>Highlighted Selected Cell</h6>
<p>The current selected cell is highlighted upon selection for better user experience.</p>

<h6>Undo Functionality</h6>
<p>All edits get pushed onto a stack, so you can undo the last change.
    Undo reverts both the cell contents and any affected computations.</p>

<h6>FormulaError Quality of Life</h6>
<p>If for example A1 is 1 and B1 is "=A1+1" and you happen to remove the dependency of A1, 
    the GUI will show a pop up for the FormulaError and display that in the cell and everytime you click on it
    it will show you the problem. This is a super small detail but just want to show you how it works
    you are still able to edit and it still behaves like a regular spreadsheet. There will still be an error in the cell.</p>
